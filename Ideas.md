Ideas
=====

## The light hurts you ##

* The Photoelectric effect
* mining game - you spend your time underground; shafts of light need to be avoided


## Mutation ##
## Shapeshift ##

* Butterfly game - harvest stuff to grow into a butterfly
* Some atom fusion kind of thing where you collect electrons/protos etc and get score by converting into a new element; show valid next atoms
* Platform game with radioactive sources; stepping on the source changes you and you get new skills which help you progress.  Mutation might take time to kick in or dissipate.  You could carry the reactive sources - they get labeled like in alice in wonderland.
* Werewolf silhouette game.  Time changes and as you progress and you convert at night


## Indirect Control ##
## You don't control the Hero ##

* You rotate the world to navigate a fixed character; perhaps reuse creating elements game
* Photoelectric effect - but you adjust the field which creates gaps which causes the photons to miss you (don't use photoelctric)
* you work in an observatory and need to make discoveries.  To achieve that you need to feed and water (tea) the astronomer.


## You are the Dungeon ##

* a maze - move walls to block off invading adventurers
* mining game, you control/move the resources?
?


## Create LifeÂ ##

* Pregnant woman platform/zelda style game.  You have (very sped up 9 months) and need to collect stuff to help feed the baby.  Aim is to get biggest baby possible.  As you eat you grow, which then means you can't go into some areas and need to sitdown after a long walk.


## Death is Progress ##

* cell based atom game, but you have limited mutation/bits to grow from.  'die'ing gives you more bits to grow from
* some re-incarnation game?  work your way through various animals 


## Adaptation ##

* reuse the mutation platform games
* Veroni diagram game, a stylized cell growth game


## Build your way out ##

* Cheap tetris style clone?
* build a rocket, and escape to the starts - or use the plot of the Martian; escape Mars


## Limited View ##

* perhaps steal some ideas from Microworld
* big game area but very small window into it.  
* Observatory game, you get a small view into the universe.  Hunt for comets/alien life/asteroids?   Perhaps something about stopping an asteroid hitting the world


## Microworld ##

* Could re-use the mutation radioactive idea; thing big world, small world, alice in wonderland
* some massive silhouette game in super small detail.  Multiple rows on th screen and each one shows like a graphic novel
* mining game 


## Two Colors ##

* go with a engraving style of artwork - do favorite game above.
* could do the companion idea with each char a different color?


## One Item, Choose ##

* Radioactive mutation game above; but you can only choose one of the radioactive sources at a time
* silhouette game but only hold one item at a time


## One Massive Enemy ##

* Stop an asteroid destroying the world; missile command remake but with one massive asteroid.  Little bits can break off to make it more involved
* do the rock climbing game - the massive enemy is death by falling


## Companion ##

* silhouette game where there are two characters, both are controlled at the same time - so it takes blocking one char to change the relative distance between them.  They must meet to progress.  Could be above and below each other, or at opposite ends.
* The observatory idea in indirect control
* something involving a 'buddy', abseiling and your companion supports/helps you.  Mining game etc


## Everything is Connected ##

* could use the companion silhouette idea
* weird incredible machine type game; big interconnected set of boards, scaffolding etc where as you walk it changes shape.
* ecosystem game; oxygen for you to breath, you create CO2, plants need CO2 ... think the Martian
* kerplunk type game, perhaps styled as a mining game.


## 3 Rules ##

* platform with 3 skills; grow, shrink, jump
* mining game with three different resources; coal, oil and wind
?


## Everything Falls Apart ##

* Kerplunk game from everythings connected
* mining game where if left alone everything falls appart, you need to run around and bolt stuff back together.  Think Dwarf fortess self collapse.


## Limited resources ##

* silhouette mining game - oil drilling or coal mining.
* ecosystem type game, like in Everything connected
