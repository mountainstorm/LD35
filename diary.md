02:00: Theme released
06:30: Awake - read theme, realise I don't I have any good ideas for Shapeshift
06:34: Look at what others have created in 4 hours; get depressed
07:15: F1 Qualifying about to start ... but I've decided on an idea
08:21: How do I collide hundreds of items in Phaser?
10:15: Discarded the original control idea, and now (with bitmaps) fighting Phaser to enable physics
11:51: Basic mechanics are working - wondering about using dynamic shapes rather than atoms
12:19: Restructured code and now javascript is doing stupid things
13:10: Basic gameplay working, need to figure out scoring
14:19: Decaying and config of most things working ... how do you 'win'
17:11: Scoring working and lots of tweaks, giving chain reactions.  It's starting to feel like a game
18:11: It's a game!
