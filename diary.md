02:00: Theme released
06:30: Awake - read theme, realise I don't I have any good ideas for Shapeshift
06:34: Look at what others have created in 4 hours; get depressed
07:15: F1 Qualifying about to start ... but I've decided on an idea
08:21: How do I collide hundreds of items in Phaser?
10:15: Discarded the original control idea, and now (with bitmaps) fighting Phaser to enable physics
11:51: Basic mechanics are working - wondering about using dynamic shapes rather than atoms
12:19: Restructured code and now javascript is doing stupid things
13:10: Basic gameplay working, need to figure out scoring
14:19: Decaying and config of most things working ... how do you 'win'
17:11: Scoring working and lots of tweaks, giving chain reactions.  It's starting to feel like a game
18:11: It's a game!  but its got a memory leak
19:18: I'm happy with the general gameplay, although I now need to fix the bugs
20:55: I'm triggering a Webkit crash on iOS; can't figure out how to avoid it.  Pondering making a score screen
22:48: Been playing with new, smaller, graphics but I seem to prefer my placehodlers eek!  Done for the night

06:53: Awake, down on my computer.  F1 race on TV (double win).  Makea list of all the enhancements I've got plannd
07:22: Awesome F1 race ... more than a tad distracting
09:31: Highscore table done, graphics done - time to do menu before sorting out sound
11:25: All the screens done - I don't like them, but there done.  Now sound
13:32: Got the music planned, having a break before I dive in and record the final version
15:07: Music sorted and key sound effects done; all that remains is tweaking, testing and the boring bits
15:53: Got bored trying to add checkboxes for sound etc .. had a break
