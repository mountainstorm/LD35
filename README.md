## Description ##

It's all Hydrogen, but it wants to be so much more ... only you can help!

You play the role of 'High Energy', the physics overlord.  Using the power of energy, agitate nearby Hydrogen and shift it's quantum structure into Helium-4.

Hold tight, as once you start wielding that power even 'High Energy' will not be able to fully control what happens, and you don't want to end up with Lithium-7 all over the place.


## Instructions ##
* Click or tap to select two elements, and use your power to catapult them toward each other
* If they collide fast enough, and form a valid combination they will fuse into another element releasing energy as heat
* Heat the screen and form chain reactions to gain bonuses


## Notes ##
* In testing I've experienced some issues on iOS platforms


## ToDo ##

* Traverse selection through decay

* Loading screen
* Improve Sounds
* Sound/Music toggles
* Esc to quit

* Tweak selection; move tests and hold
* Reduce the select range

* Find the memory leak which affects mobile devices
* Optimize
